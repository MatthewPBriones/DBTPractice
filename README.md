# Project Name
2025 Crime Watch: CHI vs SFO vs SEA

## Description
I am working with Socrata data's open city API's to track crime data over the course of this year for Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle! I will be trying to use either Looker Studio or an open source visualization tool to visualize the data changes each week.
